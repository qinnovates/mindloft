TARA - Telemetry Awareness and Response Analyzer

A comprehensive neural security platform for brain-computer interfaces.
Combines neural simulation, attack modeling, and real-time monitoring
in a unified framework aligned with the ONI 14-layer model.

Named after Tara, the Buddhist goddess of protection who guides
travelers safely through darkness — with 8 forms protecting against
8 fears, just as TARA protects neural interfaces across all ONI layers.

Components:
- Core: Coherence metrics, 14-layer model, neural firewall
- Simulation: Neural network simulation (neurons, synapses, networks)
- Attacks: Attack pattern generation and injection
- NSAM: Neural Signal Assurance Monitoring for neural interfaces
- Visualization: Real-time dashboards and analytics
- UI: Web interface for non-technical users

Quick Start:
    >>> from tara import NeuralFirewall, AttackSimulator, NeuralNSAM
    >>> from tara.simulation import LayeredNetwork
    >>> from tara.ui import launch_dashboard

    >>> # Create ONI-aligned network
    >>> network = LayeredNetwork.create_oni_model()

    >>> # Initialize Neural Signal Assurance Monitoring
    >>> nsam = NeuralNSAM()

    >>> # Launch unified dashboard
    >>> launch_dashboard()

CLI Usage:
    $ tara ui                    # Launch web dashboard
    $ tara simulate --network oni --duration 1000
    $ tara attack --scenario ransomware --target network.json
    $ tara monitor --input signals.json --realtime
