# The Liminal Phase: How Quantum Tunneling Time Could Secure Your Brain

### *What happens inside a quantum barrier — and why it might be the key to unhackable neural interfaces*

· · ·

*Picture this* — It's 2035. Your neural implant receives a software update. But it wasn't from Neuralink.

Someone just pushed code directly into your brain. And by the time you realize something's wrong, the attack has already modified how you perceive your own thoughts.

This isn't science fiction. It's the security nightmare that keeps BCI researchers up at night. Current neural interfaces have no way to distinguish legitimate signals from injected ones. Once an attacker gains access to the channel, they own your cognition.

But what if the physics of reality itself could tell the difference?

## The Discovery That Changes Everything

In July 2025, Professor Dong Eon Kim's team at POSTECH published something remarkable in *Physical Review Letters*. They discovered that when electrons tunnel through barriers — the quantum mechanical phenomenon where particles pass through obstacles they shouldn't have the energy to cross — they don't pass cleanly through.

**They collide with atomic nuclei *inside* the barrier.**

This phenomenon, called **Under-the-Barrier Recollision (UBR)**, overturns decades of assumption. The barrier interior isn't empty space that particles ghost through. It's an active zone where measurable interactions occur.

Here's why that matters for your brain:

If tunneling has characteristic dynamics — a signature that depends on the specific barrier — then **legitimate signals produce predictable patterns**. And foreign signals? They don't.

· · ·

## The Liminal Phase

I call this the **liminal phase** — the state between states. During quantum tunneling, the particle exists as a probability wave spanning the entire barrier. It's neither here nor there. It's in transition.

And transitions, it turns out, can be monitored.

The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics recognized John Martinis, John Clarke, and Michel Devoret for proving that quantum tunneling happens at macroscopic scales — systems large enough to hold in your hand. We're not talking about abstract subatomic effects. We're talking about engineering-relevant phenomena.

Meanwhile, brain-computer interfaces are shrinking. Neuralink threads are 5 micrometers wide. Neurotassel probes have cross-sections of 3 × 1.5 micrometers. And the nanostructured coatings on modern electrodes? Those operate at 2-10 nanometers — scales where quantum tunneling isn't just possible, it's *dominant*.

**The collision course is happening now.**

## Three Ways Tunneling Could Secure BCIs

### 1. Tunneling Time Signatures

Every barrier has a characteristic tunneling traversal time — the duration a particle spends inside. Recent attoclock experiments measure these times with attosecond precision (10⁻¹⁸ seconds).

**The security concept:**

```
Legitimate signal → Known barrier → Predictable timing → ACCEPT
Attack signal    → Known barrier → Anomalous timing  → REJECT
```

An attacker injecting signals wouldn't know the precise tunneling time of your device's specific barriers. Their signals would arrive with wrong timing signatures. Detectable. Rejectable.

**The catch:** Attosecond timing at biological temperatures isn't feasible yet. This is a 10-15 year research horizon.

### 2. Under-the-Barrier Recollision Detection

The POSTECH discovery opens a more elegant possibility. If electrons collide with nuclei inside the barrier, those collisions create characteristic patterns — like a fingerprint.

Engineer barriers with specific atomic structures. Legitimate signals produce predictable collision signatures. Attack signals don't.

**Connection to the ONI framework:** In my Scale-Frequency Invariant (`f × S ≈ k`), increasing interaction frequency (f) must collapse spatial coherence (S). During UBR, frequency spikes. This should be measurable. Attack signals with wrong collision dynamics violate the expected relationship.

**The catch:** UBR detection currently requires intense laser fields. Not exactly implant-compatible.

### 3. Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs)

Here's the near-term opportunity.

**QPUFs already exist.** They exploit quantum effects to create device fingerprints that cannot be cloned — guaranteed by the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics.

```
Challenge → Quantum structure → Tunneling-based response
           ↓
Response depends on:
  - Atomic-scale manufacturing variations (unique per device)
  - Quantum randomness (unpredictable)
  - No-cloning theorem (uncopyable)
```

Market projections show >80% penetration of PUF technology in medical devices by 2030. Quantum dot optical PUFs were demonstrated in *Nature Communications Materials* this year. The technology is maturing.

**For BCIs:** Embed QPUFs at the neural interface. Each device has a unique quantum identity. Authentication becomes physics-based, not just cryptography-based.

**The catch:** Biocompatibility testing for quantum structures in neural implants hasn't been done. But this is a 3-5 year research problem, not a fundamental barrier.

· · ·

## The `f × S ≈ k` Framework Applied

Let me connect this to the coherence framework I've been developing:

> **`f × S ≈ k`**

Where:
- **f** = frequency of interaction/probing
- **S** = spatial extent of coherence
- **k** = system stability constant

**In quantum computing:** Probing a quantum computer (increasing f) collapses coherence (S). Computation fails. This is a denial-of-service attack written into physics.

**In QKD:** Eavesdropping increases interaction frequency. Coherence collapses. But collapse *is* the alarm — the attack is detected.

**In tunneling-based BCI security:** During the liminal phase, the system exists in coherent superposition. Any external probe increases f. Coherence drops. The timing signature changes.

**The attacker cannot observe without disturbing. The disturbance is detectable.**

This is the same principle that makes QKD secure — applied to the electrode-tissue interface itself.

## What's Actually Possible When

Let me be honest about timelines:

```
+---------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Timeframe     | Capability                                     |

## The Catch: What We Don't Know

This framework isn't bulletproof. There are gaps I can't fill yet.

**Does quantum tunneling actually occur at neural interfaces in ways we can exploit?** The math says it should at nanoscale coatings. But "should" isn't "does."

**Can we detect tunneling signatures at biological temperatures?** Current attoclocks work in cryogenic vacuum. Your brain is warm and wet.

**Is `f × S ≈ k` the right framework?** I derived it from neural signaling principles and quantum coherence theory. It needs experimental validation.

**Will quantum effects at BCIs create vulnerabilities before we develop defenses?** This keeps me up at night.

I'm publishing anyway because we need shared vocabulary. Quantum physicists, neuroscientists, and security engineers need to talk to each other. This paper is a conversation starter, not a finished product.

## Part of Something Larger: The ONI Framework

This research extends the ONI (Organic Neural Interface) framework into quantum territory.

Previous work established:
- **Coherence Breach**: The moment when neural signal integrity is compromised
- **The Scale-Frequency Invariant**: `f × S ≈ k` as a constraint on probing and coherence
- **Layer 8+ Security**: Security models for the neural interface domain

This paper adds:
- **The Liminal Phase**: Tunneling traversal as a security-relevant state
- **UBR Detection**: Under-the-barrier dynamics as authentication primitive
- **QPUF Integration**: Quantum device fingerprinting for BCIs

The vision: neural interfaces secured not just by cryptography, but by the fundamental physics of quantum mechanics. Eavesdropping becomes physically impossible, not just computationally hard.

## What's Next

If you're a **quantum physicist**: Tell me where the `f × S ≈ k` framework breaks down. What am I missing about tunneling dynamics at room temperature?

If you're a **BCI engineer**: What are the actual dimensions of your electrode nanostructures? At what scales do you see quantum effects?

If you're a **security researcher**: How would you attack a tunneling-authenticated interface? What side channels exist in quantum systems?

If you're a **neuroscientist**: Is there evidence for tunneling in ion channels that could be exploited? What coherence times have you measured at synapses?

If you're at a **funding agency**: The gap between quantum physics and BCI security is where the next generation of threats — and defenses — will emerge. We need cross-disciplinary research now, not after the first quantum attack on a neural implant.
