## Pillars

### [Neurosecurity](neurosecurity/) — BCI Security Research

Brain-computer interfaces are being implanted in humans today. This pillar builds the security frameworks to protect them.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [QIF Framework](neurosecurity/qif/) | Quantum Indeterminacy Framework — 9 architectural docs + 9 governance docs |
| [Legacy Core (ONI)](neurosecurity/legacy-core/) | 31 publications, Python packages, TARA platform |
| [Autodidact](autodidact/) | ONI Academy, learning visualizations, BCI fundamentals |

**Key resources:**
- [QIF Framework (9 docs)](neurosecurity/qif/framework/) — read in order, 01 through 09
- [Governance (9 docs)](neurosecurity/qif/governance/) — neuroethics, regulatory compliance, consent
- [Publications (31 papers)](neurosecurity/legacy-core/publications/) — coherence metric, neural firewall, quantum encryption
- [Interactive Visualizations (13+ tools)](docs/visualizations/) — web-based framework demos
- [Whitepaper](docs/whitepaper/)

**Python packages:**
```bash
pip install oni-framework   # 14-layer model, coherence metric, neural firewall
pip install oni-tara        # TARA — real-time BCI security monitoring
pip install oni-academy     # Educational modules
```

## Project Evolution

Every version of this project is preserved. The journey from initial concept to the current QIF framework is part of the research itself — it shows how the problem was identified, how the thinking evolved, and why a quantum-informed approach became necessary.

| Version | Date | What It Was | Live Link |
|---------|------|-------------|-----------|
| **v1** | Jan 18, 2026 | First public page. "BCIs are being implanted in humans today — with no security standard." Introduced the ONI 14-layer model as "The OSI of Mind." | [View v1](https://qinnovates.github.io/mindloft/legacy/v1/) |
| **v2** | Jan 22, 2026 | Expanded documentation. Refined the 14-layer presentation and added interactive layer visualization. | [View v2](https://qinnovates.github.io/mindloft/legacy/v2/) |
| **v3** | Jan 24, 2026 | Visual storytelling shift. Added Three.js and scroll-driven animations. "No standards. No ethics. No security. Until now." | [View v3](https://qinnovates.github.io/mindloft/legacy/v3/) |
| **v4** | Jan 26, 2026 | Architecture refinement. Stabilized the immersive visual direction with GSAP ScrollTrigger. | [View v4](https://qinnovates.github.io/mindloft/legacy/v4/) |
| **v5** | Jan 28, 2026 | Final ONI iteration. Full interactive layer explorer, governance sections, polished narrative. | [View v5](https://qinnovates.github.io/mindloft/legacy/v5/) |
| **ONI Whitepaper** | Jan 30, 2026 | Complete technical whitepaper. Coherence metric, scale-frequency invariant, neural firewall, TARA platform. The culmination of the ONI framework. | [View whitepaper](https://qinnovates.github.io/mindloft/legacy/whitepaper-oni/) |
| **Current (QIF)** | Feb 2, 2026 | Paradigm shift. ONI becomes legacy. QIF (Quantum Indeterministic Framework) rebuilds from neuroscience constraints with quantum-informed security. BCI-adaptive mode, AI voiceover, immersive whitepaper. | [View current](https://qinnovates.github.io/mindloft/) |

> **Why preserve all versions?** The original v1 identified the right problem — BCIs have no security standard. Each iteration refined the approach. The transition from ONI to QIF wasn't abandoning that vision, it was deepening it: moving from a network-security analogy to a framework grounded in the actual physics and neuroscience of the bio-digital boundary.
