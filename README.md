# ONI Framework
*"The OSI of Mind"*

> **ONI**: Organic Neurocomputing Interface — A 14-layer framework extending OSI for brain-computer interface (BCI) security.

An extensible framework for monitoring and securing neural communications, designed for transparency and interoperability across brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

---

## Privacy & Ethics Statement

**ONI is NOT a surveillance framework.**

The ONI Framework exists to **protect** neural privacy and ensure the **integrity** of brain-computer interfaces. Its purpose is:

- **Defense** against malicious attacks (nation-state actors, cybercriminals, ransomware)
- **Protection** from accidental risks (MRI exposure, electromagnetic interference, device malfunction)
- **Privacy preservation** ensuring neural data remains confidential
- **Availability** maintaining BCI functionality when users depend on it
- **Human sovereignty** keeping humans in control of their own neural interfaces

The framework provides security without requiring surveillance. Signal integrity can be validated without reading thoughts. Attacks can be detected without decoding intent. The goal is to implement BCI security that preserves confidentiality, integrity, and availability — the same principles that protect all other computing systems.

## Python Library

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/oni-framework.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/oni-framework)
[![Tests](https://github.com/qikevinl/ONI/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/qikevinl/ONI/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

The ONI Framework is available as a Python package for researchers and developers.

### Installation

```bash
pip install oni-framework
```

### Quick Start

```python
from oni import CoherenceMetric, NeuralFirewall, ONIStack

# Calculate signal coherence (Cₛ)
metric = CoherenceMetric(reference_freq=40.0)  # 40 Hz gamma band
cs = metric.calculate(
    arrival_times=[0.0, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075],
    amplitudes=[100, 98, 102, 99]
)
print(f"Coherence Score: {cs:.3f}")  # 0 = untrusted, 1 = fully coherent

# Use the Neural Firewall
firewall = NeuralFirewall(threshold_high=0.6, threshold_low=0.3)
from oni.firewall import Signal
signal = Signal(arrival_times=[0.0, 0.025], amplitudes=[100, 102], authenticated=True)
result = firewall.filter(signal)
print(f"Decision: {result.decision.name}")  # ACCEPT, ACCEPT_FLAG, or REJECT

# Explore the 14-layer model
stack = ONIStack()
print(stack.layer(8).name)  # "Neural Gateway" - the firewall layer
print(stack.ascii_diagram())  # Visual representation

# Neurosecurity: Kohno's CIA triad + BCI Anonymizer (NEW)
from oni.neurosecurity import NeurosecurityFirewall, BCIAnonymizer, ThreatType

# Validate signals against Kohno's threat model
ns_firewall = NeurosecurityFirewall()
# decision = ns_firewall.validate(signal)  # ALLOW, BLOCK, or EMERGENCY_SHUTOFF

# Filter privacy-sensitive information (BCI Anonymizer)
anonymizer = BCIAnonymizer()
# result = anonymizer.anonymize(signal_data)
# print(f"Privacy Score: {result.metrics.privacy_score}")  # Lower = more private
```

## Objective

Brain-computer interfaces are being implanted in humans today, yet we lack standardized security frameworks for protecting neural communications. This project aims to:

1. **Establish shared vocabulary** — Define the attack surfaces, threat models, and defense mechanisms for neural interfaces before exploits emerge in the wild

2. **Bridge disciplines** — Translate cybersecurity principles into neuroscience contexts and vice versa, creating a common language for cross-domain collaboration

3. **Build proactively** — Develop security primitives (like the Coherence Metric) that can be implemented in hardware before BCIs reach mainstream adoption

4. **Invite scrutiny** — This framework is intentionally public and open. I want neuroscientists to challenge the biological assumptions, security researchers to find holes, and ethicists to identify governance gaps

**This is a living research project.** If you see flaws, have ideas, or want to collaborate — open an issue, submit a PR, or reach out directly. The goal isn't to be right; it's to build something robust enough to protect the most sensitive interface humanity will ever create: the one between technology and the mind.

## Key Components

### The 14-Layer ONI Model

<p align="center">
  <img src="MAIN/resources/images/oni-14-layer-hourglass.png" alt="ONI Framework 14-Layer Model" width="700">
</p>

Extends the classical OSI networking model with 7 additional layers for neural and cognitive systems:

| Layers | Domain | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **L1-L7** | Classical OSI Networking | Physical → Application (standard networking) |
| **L8** | Neural Gateway | **THE FIREWALL** — Bridge between silicon and biology |
| **L9-L10** | Signal Processing | Neural filtering, digitization, protocol encoding |
| **L11-L12** | Cognitive Transport | Session management, state tracking, reliable delivery |
| **L13-L14** | Semantic/Identity | Intent interpretation, ethics, continuity of self |

**Key Principle:**
- **OSI (L1-L7)** answers: *How does data move?*
- **ONI (L8-L14)** answers: *Should it move, can it be trusted, and what does it mean — especially when the endpoint is a human brain?*

**L8 (Neural Gateway) is the critical boundary** — most attacked, least standardized, most dangerous layer.

For complete layer definitions, see [ONI_LAYERS.md](MAIN/ONI_LAYERS.md) — the authoritative reference.

### The Coherence Metric

Mathematical framework for validating neural signal trustworthiness:

```
Cₛ = e^(−(σ²φ + σ²τ + σ²γ))
```

| Component | Variable | Measures | Security Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Phase** | σ²φ | Timing jitter | Detects out-of-sync signal injections |
| **Transport** | σ²τ | Pathway reliability | Flags signals bypassing biological routes |
| **Gain** | σ²γ | Amplitude stability | Catches over/under-powered attacks |

**Interpretation:** Cₛ ranges from 0 (untrusted) to 1 (fully coherent). Signals below threshold are rejected before reaching neural tissue.

### Neural Signal Assurance Model (NSAM)

Physiology-first defense framework with checkpoints:

1. **Signal Existence** — Should this signal exist at all?
2. **Signal Integrity** — Is it biologically plausible?
3. **Intent & Context** — Does it make sense right now?
4. **Outcome Monitoring** — What effect is it causing?
5. **Human Sovereignty** — Does the human retain agency?

## Quick Reference

### Attack Surfaces by Layer

| Layer | Domain | Attack Surface | Example Threat |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| L1-L4 | OSI | Network infrastructure | MitM, DDoS, BlueBorne-style exploits |
| L5-L7 | OSI | Application protocols | Packet injection, API exploits |
| **L8** | **Gateway** | **Neural boundary** | **Bypass attacks, unauthorized write access** |
| L9 | Signal | Hardware/DSP | Signal injection, jamming, impedance manipulation |
| L10-L11 | Protocol | Neural encoding | Protocol manipulation, session hijacking |
| L12-L13 | Cognitive | State/Intent | Context corruption, semantic attacks |
| L14 | Identity | Self-model | Long-term manipulation, identity attacks |

**External Physical Threats** (documented in [ONI_LAYERS.md](MAIN/ONI_LAYERS.md)):
- MRI exposure, electromagnetic interference, physical trauma, intentional jamming, proximity attacks (ProxMark-style)

### Hardware Constraints (Neuralink N1 Reference)

| Constraint | Value | Security Implication |
|------------|-------|---------------------|
| Power budget | 25mW total | Firewall gets ~3-5mW max |
| Latency | <1ms required | Real-time validation needed |
| Electrodes | 1,024 channels | High-bandwidth monitoring |
| Form factor | ~1mm² | Minimal silicon for security |
