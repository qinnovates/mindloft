// ANIMATION NOTES:
// - Scene 2 (Problem): NEW selling points phase after "ONI Framework" intro
//   - Universal, Secure by Design, Biodigital Ready - staggered reveal
// - Scene 4 (Coherence): Show threshold trigger → defense mechanism activation
//   - Visual: Gauge drops below threshold → shield/alert animation
//   - Examples: MRI interference, electromagnetic disruption, injection attacks
// - Scene 4 (Scale-Frequency): Animated visualization of f × S ≈ k
//   - Scale bar grows (10→1000), Frequency shrinks (100→1 Hz), k stays ~1000
// - Scene 6 ("...and you"): SLOW PAN-IN with WHITE TEXT and glow for emphasis
// - Scene 7 (CTA): Cycling pip install animation (framework → tara → academy)
// - Scene 8 (Credits): Dynamic circular wave animation on "Welcome to" finale
// - Cold Open: Wave grid fades in 5 seconds before transition for continuity
