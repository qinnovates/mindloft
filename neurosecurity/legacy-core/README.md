## What This Is

This folder contains the original ONI (Open Neurosecurity Interoperability) research — publications, Python packages, interactive tools, and the analytical foundation that informed the [QIF (Quantum Indeterministic Framework for Neural Security)](../qif/).

## Relationship to the New Framework

The QIF (Quantum Indeterministic Framework for Neural Security) (v2) was built by identifying what was wrong with this original model and rebuilding from neuroscience constraints. Key learnings:

1. **BCIs are physical hardware** — they belong at OSI Layer 1, not Layer 8
2. **The brain is a cycle, not a stack** — the funnel model replaced the linear layer model
3. **Consciousness can't be modeled** — v1 relied too heavily on abstract concepts of "self"
4. **Quantum unknowns need containers** — the Q integer concept emerged from this gap

The publications here remain valid research. The architectural model evolved.
