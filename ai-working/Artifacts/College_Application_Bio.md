# Bio/Backstory for College Application

I started in IT at a biotech company out of college - walking through university labs, watching science happen up close. That first role taught me to appreciate the interface between technology and biology.

Each step since has been its own interface. Blackstone taught me to identify solutions the world actually needs. Tinder taught me that relationships drive everything. Match Group taught me that every setback is a redirection - closed doors reveal open ones.

That led to a decade in cyber threat intelligence, identifying patterns and predicting attacks before they have names. During a recent sabbatical, I explored China - seeing firsthand how technology and culture interface differently across the world.

Looking back, my career has been a series of interfaces: science and technology, problems and solutions, people and connection, setbacks and new directions, East and West.

Maybe that's why BCIs feel inevitable to me. The ultimate interface - where silicon meets neuron, where human meets machine. ONI isn't just a framework I built. It's the pattern I've been tracing my whole career.
