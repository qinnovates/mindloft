Hello, world. 👋

I'm an independent security researcher with an incurable curiosity for how complex systems break and how to design and deploy them at scale so they don't. My work lives at the intersection of a strange but fascinating vector space in time: **cybersecurity, neuroethics, and AI-driven systems**.

Over the last ~15 years, I've worked across biotech IT, security engineering, and engineering leadership, often stepping into environments where the data existed but the systems didn't. I've spent much of my time wiring together disparate data sources, building and deploying enterprise security pipelines, and designing the frameworks and processes that turn raw telemetry into something my teams and I can actually reason about.

The goal was never just visibility—it was **anticipation**. By normalizing data, extracting common structure, and codifying how signals should behave, we built systems that could identify attacks before they fully materialized, not just react after the fact. That kind of work forces you to think simultaneously like an engineer, an adversary, and a human operator interpreting the output.

That mindset of identifying gaps, assessing risk, and designing/deploying secure systems at scale that make uncertainty measurable and action possible is what continues to drive my work today.
